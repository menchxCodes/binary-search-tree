# Creating and balancing a binary search tree in Ruby
I learned a lot from this [The Odin Project Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-binary-search-trees). I got much needed hands-on practice with recursion. My main point of struggle was with Blocks and calling them in my recursive methods. But I'm glad that I stuck to it and figured it out!
